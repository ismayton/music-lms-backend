Demo version should behave as a logged in user or teacher via toggle

User can add a course
User can load a course and "complete" lessons

Teacher can create a course 
* add course
* add lessons to course 
    * lessons can have a title, content, and video link
Teacher can edit a course/lesson
Teacher can delete a course/lesson

Lesson keeps track of Users that have completed (??? how to do this cleanly)

Models:
# = wishlist

User (one for demo)
:username - string
:password - string
has_secure_password
uniqueness: true
# username and password for oAuth
has_many :courses

Teacher (one for demo, admin level)
:username - string
:password - string
has_secure_password
uniqueness: true
# username and password for oAuth
has_many :courses

Course (just one for demo)
:id - uuid()
:title - string
has_many :lessons
has_many :users 
belongs_to :teacher

Lesson 
:completed_users - array with usernames
:title - string 
:content - string
:video_url - string (link)

Stretch Goals:
OAuth for users and teachers (figure out what params we need for this)
